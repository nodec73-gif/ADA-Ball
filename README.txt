# 🎱 The Council — Oracle Prototype

**The Council** is a web-based mystical oracle inspired by the classic Magic 8 Ball, reimagined for the Cardano ecosystem.

Users ask a yes/no question, optionally donate ADA, and receive a cryptic answer — **YES**, **NO**, or **MAYBE** — as the Council deliberates within an animated oracle ball.

This project is an **experimental prototype** exploring ritual, chance, and interaction, with future plans for Cardano wallet integration.

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 Oracle ball with animated deliberation and reveal
- 🌓 Outcomes limited to **YES / NO / MAYBE**
- 💠 Donation tiers influence *how long* and *how seriously* the Council deliberates
- 🆓 Free play mode (no wallet required)
- 🎧 Deliberation and reveal sound effects
- 🔥 Ambient animated effects (aura, candle flames)
- 🜏 Hidden **Ritual Mode** for testing (keyboard-triggered)
- 📱 Responsive two-column layout (desktop & mobile)
- ⚖️ Clear legal disclaimers

## 🧠 How It Works

- Users enter a question
- They select a donation tier (or free option)
- The Council “deliberates” for a duration based on contribution
- The answer is revealed inside the oracle ball

> The donation **does not directly control outcomes** — it only affects the *perceived effort* of the Council.

---

## 🆓 Free Mode

A free (no ADA) option is provided for users who do not wish to connect a wallet.

In this mode:
- The Council responds dismissively
- Outcomes are random
- No mystical weight is implied

---

## 🜏 Ritual Mode (Testing)

A hidden testing mode exists for development purposes.

**Keyboard combination:**


When enabled:
- Maximum deliberation power is simulated
- No wallet is required
- Console logs indicate Ritual Mode state

> ⚠️ Ritual Mode is for testing only and should be disabled in production builds.

## 🔊 Audio

The experience includes:
- A looping deliberation ambience
- A reveal sound on outcome

Audio is user-gesture triggered (browser compliant).

## 🧩 Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (animations, overlays, effects)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- No backend (static site)
- Designed for future Cardano wallet APIs (Nami, Lace, Eternl)

## 🚧 Roadmap (Planned)

- 🔗 Cardano wallet connection
- 💸 On-chain ADA donations
- 🧪 Testnet / Mainnet toggle
- 📜 On-chain logging or NFTs
- 🕯️ Enhanced animated background layers
- 📊 Optional transparency metrics
